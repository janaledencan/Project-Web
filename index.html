            Karate, (Japanese: “empty hand”) unarmed martial-arts discipline employing kicking, striking, 
            and defensive blocking with arms and legs. Emphasis is on concentrating as much of the body’s 
            power as possible at the point and instant of impact. Striking surfaces include the hands 
            (particularly the knuckles and the outer edge), ball of the foot, heel, forearm, knee, and 
            elbow. All are toughened by practice blows against padded surfaces or wood. Pine boards up to
            several inches in thickness can be broken by the bare hand or foot of an expert. Timing, 
            tactics, and spirit, however, are each considered at least as important as physical toughening.
          </p>
          <p>
            In sporting karate and sparring (kumite) in training, blows and kicks are stopped short, 
            preferably within an inch of contact. Sporting matches commonly last about three minutes, 
            to a decision, if neither contestant has scored a clean “killing” point in the estimation 
            of the judges. Contests of form (kata) are also held, in which single competitors perform 
            predetermined series of movements simulating defense and counterattack against several 
            opponents. Performances are scored by a panel of judges, as in gymnastics.

            Karate evolved in East Asia over a period of centuries, becoming systematized in Okinawa in 
            the 17th century, probably by people forbidden to carry weapons. It was imported into Japan 
            in the 1920s. Several schools and systems developed, each favouring somewhat different 
            techniques and training methods. Karate, like other Asian martial-arts disciplines, stresses 
            mental attitude, rituals of courtesy, costumes, and a complex ranking system (by colour of 
            belt). There is some overlapping of technique with other fighting styles.

        <section class="components-container">
          <p class="first-paragraph">
          Karate practise is generally divided up into three components: Kihon (basics), Kata (forms) and Kumite 
          (sparring).Kihon (basics) covers various strikes, blocks, kicks, stances and movements one might need 
          to use in self-defence. Students practise these in lines each class so that the techniques are refined 
          and become instinctive. Kihon, or basic practise, allows students to develop an understanding of their 
          body and how it can be used as most effectively as a weapon, for example, how to generate maximum power 
          with minimum effort. Kata (forms) is often referred to as the ‘art form’ of karate. Each kata (form) is 
          a traditional predetermined pattern of movements that promotes a number of self-defence principles. 
          Kata practise also develops coordination, balance, agility, strength and speed. Kumite (sparring) is 
          where techniques and principles learnt in Kihon (basics) and Kata (forms) are applied against an opponent. 
          Kumite can vary greatly, depending on the student’s level of experience. For example, beginners only 
          practise pre-arranged kumite. This is where both the attacker and defender know exactly which techniques 
          will be used and when. They do this in a slow and controlled environment. As students develop in ability 
          and confidence, they may choose to move onto free kumite. This is where students wear protective equipment 
          and spar in an environment where techniques are exchanged freely. Karate has a coloured belt (or ranking) 
          system allowing students to set goals and measure their progress. As they progress and develop in both 
          physical and technical ability, each component becomes more advanced, giving them a new challenge and 
          skill to develop take on. As the student approaches their black belt, their technique, speed, coordination
          and stamina all become natural as a result of strong practice. It is at this stage that the serious 
          student discovers that his or her study of karate has only just begun. The object of true karate practice 
          is the perfection of oneself through the perfection of the art.

          Karate promotes a number of values to live by, including integrity, respect, courtesy, humility, 
          loyalty and compassion.Karate is an individual sport. Therefore the focus is not to compete against 
          another person or team, but rather to compete against one’s self. This ‘self focus’ accompanied 
          with continual improvement develops self-esteem and self-confidence amongst those who practice it.
          Karate also promotes self-discipline, goal setting and leadership. People who study karate can 
          attain a high level of commitment and dedication to any chosen endeavor simply because of the 
          skills and habits they develop.
